Dear Sir,

With Heavy Heart, I am writing this to you. I WAS a proud Owner of Mahindra XUV500 from Oct 17 2015 till 28 July 2016. As I am writing today, before two days, that STRONG TRUST is shattering when I experienced first and then heard from the service center person ( Devendr Patil, Swapnil Tandel, Manager @ G3 Motors Service Center Nerul, Navi Mumbai ) that CLUTCH mechanism is gone. He would be able to tell me what happened exectly after opening the Gear Box and other parts of the CAR.

Since, two days, I have not heard anything from the service center, neither there is a call from any customer care about this incident.

Having said this, I would like to know what are the next steps for
1. The pain I have gone thru while driving that vehicle to the service center.
2. TRUST that is shattered on Mahindra Vehicles ( not ONLY XUV500 now )
3. My Vehicle ( MH46AP3035 ) which is lying at G3 Motors Service Center Nerul, Navi Mumbai. First of all, what has happened to My Vehicle and second , who pays for the damages that happened to the vehicle. Third, when do I get my vehicle port the damage repair.

I am looking forward to hear from you at the earlist as I am without my Vehicle past two days with NO Conveyance or assistance from services center or sales center for that matter.

Thanking you,
Sandeep Sonkusale

Mahindra XUV500 is lying in G3 Motors Service Center Nerul, Navi Mumbai because clutch plate broke. Its 8 months OLD car with 13000 KMs on dashboard. Trust, belief is broken. Quality is degraded..
